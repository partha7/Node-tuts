JavaScript is a single threaded language. Although we can use the above methods to perform
async tasks. So under the hood node will be executing the underlying functionalities in
the functions that are made async, such as : I/O etc., and thus allow the rest of the code 
to be executed. Having said that JS execution will still happen synchronously.
