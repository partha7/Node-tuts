Web servers are what we ping whenever we request something on the browser or 
http requests etc.

Web servers can be custom, or can even be utilised from the cloud.

Most server-client interaction is done using http/https requests.

This is a 2 message communication:

1. Request message: sent by the user
2. Response message: response from the server

Both these messages have 2 major components:

1. Headers
2. Body (Request/Response)
